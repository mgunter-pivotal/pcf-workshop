= Buildpacks

== Goal

In this section, students will deploy their application with a modified buildpack.

== Check for the modified buildpack

* https://github.com/pivotalservices/pse-training-cf-bp-module
  was used to create a customized version of a buildpack for this lab....
  
. This buildpack has an added framework component that will set a Java system property containing a timestamp that indicates when the application was staged.
. The buildpack was installed (by an admin) with the command `cf create-buildpack java-staging-timestamp ./java-buildpack-staging-timestamp.zip 8 --enable`
. Students should now run `cf buildpacks` to see that this buildpack is installed!

=== Verifying your changes

. Now it's time to test our changes. The `cities-service` contains a very basic REST controller that returns the staging timestamp in response to a GET request.

. Access the `/staging` endpoint.  You should see a null timestamp as you aren't yet using your new build pack:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i http://<cities-service>/staging
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 52
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=ISO-8859-1
Date: Tue, 27 May 2014 17:23:57 GMT
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
X-Application-Context: cities:cloud:0

Application was staged at: null
----
+

. Now, re-push your app and use the `-b` flag to use your modified build pack.
. Note you should see an indication that you're not using the standard buildpack anymore!

  -----> Downloaded app buildpack cache (44M)
  -----> Java Buildpack Version: e89e546 | https://github.com/krujos/java-buildpack#e89e546

. Check the staging info provided by the Java build pack to see that our change was effective:

As you can see from the output, our timestamp was added as the final +-D+ argument in the +start_command+.

. Access your application again from your browser and access the `/staging` endpoint.  You should now see a message that contains the timestamp:
+
[source,bash]

. Edit your manifest to ensure future pushes leverage your build pack.

=== What about testing buildpack changes, or one offs?

Cloud Foundry can accept a git URL as the argument to -b. If you're iterating on a buildpack change, experimenting or do not desire to make the buildpack available to everyone this is a *much* easier way to consume a custom buildpack!

See the output of `cf push --help` for more information.
