= The Platform Operator

During this workshop your instructors (Matt) have assumed the role of Platform Operator. It's likely that at some point during the class we'll hand over the keys and have you operate the platform if you desire. You can assume that what you're being given is similar to what a new project team would receive upon requesting a fresh environment from which ever group you would ask for such things.

== Orgs
An organization is the unit of tenancy in Cloud Foundry. Within an organization there are spaces. Spaces are used to group applications and services. Spaces are generally created according to a projects SDLC or build pipeline. Spaces are free form and we believe development teams should organize them in whatever way suits their needs and objectives.

Each student has been provided an organization that follows the naming pattern <first_initial><last_initial>-org. So John Smith's would be `js-org`.

== Accounts
You've also been provided a user account. Please login to the platform using your work email address. The password for your account is `password`. Follow the prompts, and select the 'production' space.

== Spaces
Within your org you'll find two spaces. The development space is meant as a safe place for experimentation, which in this case means the only thing you can hurt is yourself. The production space is intended for live apps serving customers. For our course this means production has a lot of access, development doesn't have very much. Of course a real organization will may have more spaces. Spaces  are configurable per tenant and are the tenant's concern and management responsibility. We've preconfigured spaces and orgs for you to illustrate platform features. This will become evident further on `<evil laugh>`. It's expected during the course of normal operations a development team would customize the space layout and services to their liking, but we ask that you hold back during the workshop to facilitate our exercises.

== Discussion
We'll discuss a few things here:

. Orgs

. Spaces

. Quotas

. Users and their scope

. Application security groups
We will cover these briefly and *experience* them later.
