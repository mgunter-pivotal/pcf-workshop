== Material Format Philosophy

* *Presentations* introduce concepts.  They should not provide detail and never reformat the same content available on the docs site as bullets.  Heavily bulleted presentations tend to be boring so we favor animation.  Well rehearsed animation illustrates and explains concepts with very few words (see Onsiâ€™s talk on Diego at link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OkmVTFhfLY[CF Summit]).
+
*Note*: Powerpoint versions of the presentations are included.  These are exported from Keynote and may have formatting issues.
+

* *Docs* are for detail.  Students, developers and operators should get in the habit of reading and referring to the link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf[docs site].  Open book "quizzes" in the curriculum help ensure students read the docs.

* *Asciidoc* docs in git define the course, links and work.  They are easy to edit, format and navigate.

* *Material* is sourced from our partner training and tailored to suit The Home Depot's needs. This course is to facilitate your learning. It is intended to be highly interactive and hands on. If there are topics that interest the class we will happily diverge. Some exercises are intended to fail, either to educate about the platform or to demonstrate common pitfalls.
